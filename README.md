# Expiry Date Tracker..
We are a team of 4 members, developping an Android app using Flutter framework with Dart programming as part of our Social Relevance project. 
This Project is mainly based on tracking Expiry Dates of medicines to help medical store owners in disposing the medicines from time to time. My role is to develop the Interface of Application and to implement the QR scanner& sending scanned data into list of Medicines on a page such that it has to be touch_free.
